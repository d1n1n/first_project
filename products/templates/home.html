He was also a talented scientist, engineer, and inventor. His most famous works include the iconic "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper," both of which have had a profound influence on Western art.</p>
        <p>Da Vinci's brilliance extended beyond painting. He made significant contributions to anatomy, engineering, and flight. His notebooks, filled with sketches, scientific diagrams, and observations, offer a glimpse into the genius of one of history's most inventive minds.</p>
